# Healthcare Strategy Case Presentation — Havas Healthcare Group

This project presents a revised healthcare strategy case developed for Havas Healthcare Group.  
I independently restructured and refined the original presentation by synthesizing data-driven insights into a clear, client-ready strategic narrative.  
The revised version emphasizes actionable recommendations and effective storytelling in a healthcare consulting context, and directly led to receiving an offer.
